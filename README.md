# heriseon


CSS/html:

•In the header, search engine optimization <a> attribute wasnt working because it was missing an ID.

•The title in the head must be changed to the name of the site.

• comments were added in the css file for clarification

• Properties were placed in order from head,body,content,benefits, and footer. 

•Alot of elements shared the same properties So I added them to the parent Divs to be less repetative. 

• I added alt attributes for accessibility
